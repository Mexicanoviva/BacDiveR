## Example of a data inconsistency

Just as the correctness of data analysis code should be tested automatically, the
consistency of data should be evaluated and monitored as well. Using [BacDive's advanced search](https://bacdive.dsmz.de/AdvSearch)
and [BacDiveR's `retrieve_search_results()`](https://tibhannover.github.io/BacDiveR/reference/retrieve_search_results.html)
several examples of geographic inconsistencies have been found. Presumably due to
an overly strict location-to-country-to-continent mapping, several samples collected
from seas neighbouring Russia (like the [Sea of Japan)](https://bacdive.dsmz.de/advsearch?site=advsearch&searchparams%5B20%5D%5Bcontenttype%5D=text&searchparams%5B20%5D%5Btypecontent%5D=contains&searchparams%5B20%5D%5Bsearchterm%5D=Sea+of+Japan&searchparams%5B100%5D%5Bcontenttype%5D=text&searchparams%5B100%5D%5Btypecontent%5D=contains&searchparams%5B100%5D%5Bsearchterm%5D=&searchparams%5B17%5D%5Bsearchterm%5D=Europe&advsearch=search),
were assigned to Europe.

While one may debate where exactly border between Asia and Europe runs through Russia,
it is clear that its Eastern shoreline is located well within Asia. These and
other datasets with East Russian locations have been reported to the BacDive team
and a portion of those was corrected in [BacDive's 04.07.2018 release](https://bacdive.dsmz.de/news).

```{r data}
library(BacDiveR)
  
inconsistent_data <- retrieve_search_results(
  "https://bacdive.dsmz.de/advsearch?advsearch=search&site=advsearch&searchparams[20][contenttype]=text&searchparams[20][typecontent]=contains&searchparams[20][searchterm]=Sea+of+Japan&searchparams[17][searchterm]=Europe"
  )
```

As long as this specific inconsistency is not fixed, the above should display:
`Downloading BacDive IDs: 131115 139987`.


## How to test datasets

If a BacDive user finds an inconsistency within the datasets they use, BacDiveR's
`retrieve_search_results()` can be used to construct a test-case for such a problem.
In the following example, the test fails as long as BacDive contains datasets with
the above-described discrepancy between the `geo_loc_name` and `continent` fields.

```{r test, error=TRUE}
library(testthat)

test_that("No inconsistent datasets exist", {
  expect_null(inconsistent_data)
})
```

Once the inconsistency is corrected in BacDive, the advanced search returns no
results any more, and the above test passes. It can thus be used to monitor the
resolution of such a problem after [reporting](https://bacdive.dsmz.de/?site=contact)
it. Furthermore, the users is alerted (by the test failing again) in case new 
datasets appear in BacDive with the same inconsistency.
