Unfortunately, the BacDive Web Service does not allow SQL-like queries for the
content of specific fields within the strain's datasets. If you find the 
functionality explained in [BacDive-ing in][dive-in] too limited, please try 
the following, semi-automatic approach to using BacDiveR. 

1. Visit [BacDive.DSMZ.de/AdvSearch](https://bacdive.dsmz.de/advsearch) and 
prepare the query you are interested in.

![Overview of the possible fields to query and their parameters (contains, exact, begins/ends with)](advanced-search.png)

1. Run your advanced search (query). In the below example, I simply searched for
all strains whose publication includes someone named "Miller". **Note the** two 
"hits" on the right, and the now much longer **URL**. It contains/encodes all 
the terms and parameters of your advanced search.

1. Copy the URL of the results page from your browser's adress bar. 
Alternatively, copy it from the "Download list of BacDive Ids" link to the top
right of the "hits" list.

1. Paste the copied URL into a call to the `retrieve_search_results()` function.

1. Enjoy the list of downloaded datasets, just as you would after using
`retrieve_data(searchTerm = ..., searchType = ...)`.
