#### I have...

- [ ] ... run `make check` in the terminal and saw now errors.
- [ ] ... added/updated tests to [`/tests/testthat/`](/tests/testthat) for new features or bug-fixes.
- [ ] ... updated the [changelog / `NEWS.md` in the `Unreleased` section](/NEWS.md#unreleased), if my PR introduces user-facing changes.
- [ ] ... read (at least) the [`LICENCSE` (short version)](/LICENSE) and agreed that it will apply to my contribution as well. 

#### If this is a relase PR, additionally

- [ ] Move [`Unreleased` changes in `NEWS.md` to dedicated section](/NEWS.md#unreleased)
- [ ] Copy those & the new version number to [new GitHub release](https://github.com/TIBHannover/BacDiveR/releases/new), together with the
[`README.md`'s 1st paragraph](https://github.com/TIBHannover/BacDiveR/blame/master/README.md#L22-L24)
- [ ] Increment the [SemVer.org] [number in `DESCRIPTION`](/DESCRIPTION#L3).
