##### I have...

- [ ] ... run `testthat::auto_test_package()` and saw now errors.
- [ ] ... added/updated tests to `/tests/testthat/` for new features or bug-fixes.
- [ ] ... updated the [changelog / `NEWS.md`
](https://github.com/katrinleinweber/BacDiveR/blob/master/NEWS.md) in the 
`Unreleased` section, if my PR introduces user-facing changes.
- [ ] ... incremented the minor or patch version number in [`DESCRIPTION`
](https://github.com/katrinleinweber/BacDiveR/blob/master/DESCRIPTION), if my PR
is a new feature or a bug-fix.
- [ ] ...read (at least) the [`LICENCSE` (short version)
](https://github.com/katrinleinweber/BacDiveR/tree/master/LICENSE) and agreed 
that it will apply to my contribution as well. 

<!-- Thank you! -->
