#### I have...

- [ ] ... run `testthat::auto_test_package()` and saw now errors.
- [ ] ... added/updated tests to [`/tests/testthat/`](/tests/testthat) for new features or bug-fixes.
- [ ] ... updated the [changelog / `NEWS.md` in the `Unreleased` section](/NEWS.md#unreleased), if my PR introduces user-facing changes.
- [ ] ... incremented the minor or patch [version number in `DESCRIPTION`](/DESCRIPTION#L3), if my PR is a new feature or a bug-fix.
- [ ] ...read (at least) the [`LICENCSE` (short version)](/LICENSE) and agreed that it will apply to my contribution as well. 

<!-- Thank you! -->
