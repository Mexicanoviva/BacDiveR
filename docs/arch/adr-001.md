# ADR 1: Using JSON internally, instead of XML


## Context 

The [BacDive Web Service](https://bacdive.dsmz.de/api/bacdive/) can be configured to reply either in JSON or XML. The former is used in the [examples](https://bacdive.dsmz.de/api/bacdive/example/).

[R's jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/package=jsonlite) has been recommended to over the older [rjson](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rjson).


## Decision 

We will request JSON from the BacDive Web service.


## Status: accepted


## Consequences

[`construct_url()` needs to append `?format=json`
](https://tibhannover.github.io/BacDiveR/reference/construct_url.html) 
and `jsonlite::fromJSON()` needs to be used for parsing replies.
